# go-langchain

A golang implementation of [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain): Building applications with LLMs through composability

### Why ?

Because AI agents will be ubiquitous and present in any programming stack, so a langchain implementation in different languages makes sense.

### Focus

We currently focus on implementing agents that fits our use cases, instead of re-implementing the whole LangChain library.
